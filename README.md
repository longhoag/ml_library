# ML Library

A production-ready machine learning library designed for flexibility, extensibility, and ease of use.

## Overview

This library provides a comprehensive set of tools for machine learning workflows, including:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Model serialization and management
- Visualization utilities
- Integration with popular ML frameworks

## Installation

```bash
pip install ml-library
```

## Quick Start

```python
from ml_library import Model, Preprocessor

# Prepare data
preprocessor = Preprocessor()
X_train_processed = preprocessor.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_processed = preprocessor.transform(X_test)

# Train model
model = Model()
model.train(X_train_processed, y_train)

# Evaluate
score = model.evaluate(X_test_processed, y_test)
print(f"Model accuracy: {score}")

# Save model
model.save("model.pkl")
```
