# Poetry Migration Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Created new Poetry configuration**:
   - Added a comprehensive `pyproject.toml` file that includes all dependencies, build settings, and tool configurations
   - Generated a `poetry.lock` file for reproducible builds

2. **Updated documentation**:
   - Added Poetry installation instructions to README.md
   - Created a new CONTRIBUTING.md with detailed development setup instructions
   - Documented the migration process in POETRY_MIGRATION.md

3. **Updated CI/CD workflow**:
   - Modified GitHub Actions workflow to use Poetry for dependency installation and test running

4. **Updated scripts**:
   - Updated version management script to work with Poetry
   - Updated package publishing script to use Poetry commands

5. **Retained backwards compatibility**:
   - Kept original `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, and requirements files for reference

## Benefits of Poetry

- **Simplified dependency management**: All dependencies in one place
- **Reproducible builds**: Lock file ensures consistent environments
- **Virtual environment handling**: Built-in virtual environment management
- **Developer experience**: More intuitive commands for daily tasks
- **Publishing workflow**: Simplified package building and publishing

## Next Steps

1. **Run CI/CD**: Ensure GitHub Actions workflow passes with Poetry
2. **Test optional dependencies**: Verify TensorFlow and PyTorch extras work correctly
3. **Remove legacy files**: Once stable, can remove `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, and requirements files
4. **Merge to main**: If everything checks out, merge the branch to main

## Version Support

The Poetry configuration maintains support for Python 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10, matching the previous setup.
