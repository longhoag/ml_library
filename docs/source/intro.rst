Introduction
============

ML Library is a comprehensive machine learning library designed for simplicity, flexibility,
and production readiness. It provides a clean and intuitive API for common machine learning
tasks, with a focus on quality, testing, and documentation. The library is highly tested
with >95% code coverage and fully type-annotated.

Features
--------

* Simple and consistent API for common machine learning tasks
* Comprehensive suite of models (linear, logistic, random forests, etc.)
* Advanced preprocessing utilities like StandardPreprocessor and PolynomialPreprocessor
* Feature selection tools to identify the most important features
* Robust metrics evaluation for classification and regression
* Visualization tools for model evaluation and feature importance
* Production-ready with extensive testing and comprehensive error handling

ML Library is built with a focus on quality and follows best practices for
software development, including:

* Extensive type hints for better IDE support and strict mypy type checking
* Comprehensive test suite with >95% code coverage
* Detailed documentation with practical, working examples
* Hierarchical error handling with informative messages
* Configurable logging system for operational visibility
* scikit-learn compatible interfaces

ML Library is designed to be used by both beginners and experienced
practitioners in machine learning who want a reliable, well-tested,
and well-documented library for their projects.
